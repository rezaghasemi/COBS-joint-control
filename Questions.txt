What is VAV?

Replace Thermostat to VAV position. In a VAV system, each zone or area of a building is equipped with its own thermostat or temperature sensor. The VAV system regulates the volume of air supplied to each zone based on the temperature setpoint for that zone. When a zone requires more heating or cooling, the VAV system increases the volume of air supplied to that zone to meet the demand.
